### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p align="justify">ðŸ’¬ Although my main profession is being a paramedic, I've always been engaged in game development during my free time. My passion for game development began around 4-5 years ago when I started using GameMaker. My friend and I, under the name Krystal Arts, have developed and published some games and we still have some unfinished projects.</p>

<p align="justify">In order to learn C# and Unity, I took a 250-hour in-person Unity game development course and I have been trying to improve myself for almost one year.</p>

<p align="justify">âš¡ Keep in mind that some of these public repositories are old. My coding skills have improved! Feel free to ask me for access to my private repositories for code review.</p>
